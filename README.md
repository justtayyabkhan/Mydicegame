# Mydicegame
This is a basic game developed by me using my knowledge of HTML,CSS and Javascript. The concept of the game includes two players rolling dice and collecting points as the dice rolls and simultaneously adding the score to their current score, the catch is that the score resets when the players gets a '1'.
